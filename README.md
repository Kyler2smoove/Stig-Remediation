# Windows 10 STIG Remediation Scripts

This repository contains a growing collection of PowerShell scripts created to automate the implementation and remediation of **DISA STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide)** controls for Windows 10 systems.

These scripts were developed as part of my **Cybersecurity Support Internship** with the Josh Madakor CyberRange, where I focus on hands-on security hardening, vulnerability management, and compliance automation using PowerShell and Tenable.

## üìå Purpose

Each script targets a specific Windows 10 STIG ID and aims to:
- Detect system misconfigurations
- Remediate non-compliant settings
- Help ensure systems align with DISA compliance standards

---

## üß∞ Tools Used
- **PowerShell**
- **Tenable.io**
- **Azure VMs**
- **DISA STIGs v3r1 for Windows 10**
